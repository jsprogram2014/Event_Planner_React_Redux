                Welcome to GamePlan, the clutch side-kick for every organizer who’d rather focus on high scores than spreadsheets. Born out of marathon LAN nights and last-second bracket swaps, our mission is simple: make gaming-event budgeting effortless, transparent, and—let’s be honest—fun. Whether you’re booking a full-blown eSports arena, outfitting VR bays, or juggling meal packs between matches, GamePlan tallies every credit in real time.

                Drag, drop, and watch your totals level up (or down) instantly—no surprise micro-transactions here. From cozy retro-arcade gatherings to headline tournaments with hundreds of spectators, we scale to your lobby size. Our tap-friendly dashboards show you exactly where each dollar lands, so you can spend more time banning maps and less time crunching numbers.

                Behind the scenes, our small (but mighty) squad fuses pro event know-how with obsessively clean code. We believe budgets shouldn’t be buzz-kills, vendors should stay perfectly in sync, and you should feel 100 % confident pressing Start without second-guessing a single cent.

                Plan smarter. Tilt less. GG more. That’s the GamePlan promise.
