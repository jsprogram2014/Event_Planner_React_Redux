                Welcome to PlanEase, the smart sidekick for every event dreamer who’d rather spend time on the guest list than on spreadsheets. Born from late-night planning sessions and far too many coffee-fueled budget battles, our mission is simple: make event cost-tracking effortless, transparent, and—dare we say—fun.

                Whether you’re booking a grand auditorium, fine-tuning AV add-ons, or juggling multiple meal plans, PlanEase crunches every number in real time. Tap-friendly dashboards show you exactly where each dollar goes, so surprise expenses stay off the guest list. From intimate workshops to headline conferences, we adjust to your scale—drag, drop, and instantly see updated totals.

                Behind the scenes, our small (but mighty) team mixes event-planning know-how with obsessively clean code. We believe budgets shouldn’t be buzz-kills, vendors should always stay in sync, and you should feel confident hitting confirm without second-guessing a single cent.

                Plan smarter. Stress less. Celebrate more. That’s the PlanEase promise.
